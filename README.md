## Architecture of the code
For this project, we used Jupyter notebook.

The main file is project1.ipynb, from which the code can be run.

The additional files are the following :

- implementations.py : contains the 6 methods to implement, along with their helper functions.
- clean_data.py : contains the code for cleaning the data.
- split_expand_data.py : contains the code for splitting and expanding the data.

These files are imported in project1.ipynb.

## Running the code
As written above, the code for testing the different methods and obtain the predictions can simply be run from project1.ipynb.
